        <p class="line">You don’t get really good at dealing with diabetes overnight. But over time, you’ll figure out how to go from getting it done to taking it in stride. See if any of these tips are familiar (or worth trying!)</p>
        <p class="Que">Remember when you first found out you had diabetes and learned the basics of taking care of yourself?</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</li>
            <li>Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly.</li>
            <li>Stay physically active with exercises like walking, swimming, or cycling.</li>
            <li>Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods.</li>
            <li>Get enough sleep to help regulate blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>One way or another, you’ve had to try to make it all fit with family, work, school, holidays, and everything else in your life. Here’s our short list of tips to help – you’re probably familiar with many, but some may be new (feel free to use!)</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>A diet for people living with diabetes is based on eating healthy meals at regular times.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <ul>
            <li>Take the time to cook. You’re not saving time by sitting in the drive-thru anyway.</li>
            <li>Look online for budget-friendly, easy-to-make recipes. Many are so good you’ll want to eat right out of the pan.</li>
            <li>Write down or take photos of all your meals and snacks. This one trick makes you much more aware of everything you eat and helps you stay in control.</li>
            <li>Make the same food for you and your family. Healthy eating for everyone!</li>
            <li>You can’t go wrong with veggies. Take a free online cooking class to learn the secrets of making them taste delicious.</li>
            <li>Skip “diabetic” foods. They often cost more than “regular” food, and they don’t taste very good anyway.</li>
            <li>Try Meatless Monday (or any day of the week). Beans and lentils are cheap, tasty, and really good for you.</li>
            <li>Make family favorites with a twist: substitute veggies for some of the rice or pasta, or blend veggies until smooth and add to sauces.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Exercise is still one of the best tools for managing diabetes, and it’s free!</li>
            <li>Break a sweat regularly, but also find little ways to be active throughout the day, like climbing stairs and walking.</li>
            <li>Work out with a friend. You’re more likely to stick with it because you won’t want to let them down</li>
            <li>Try an activity tracker (many apps are free). It’s very motivating to watch your steps add up.</li>
            <li>Exercising by doing something you enjoy is important because if you don’t like it, you won’t stick with it. Find an activity that you and your health care provider agree you can do regularly for the best results.</li>
            <li>It’s more fun when someone else is counting on you to show up. Having a partner may help you continue to be active.</li>
            <li>a goal could be to walk a mile every day for a month or to be active every weekday for 30 minutes. Be specific and realistic. Always discuss your activity goals with your health care provider.</li>
            <li>Check out all the online workout videos. There’s something for everyone, at every level of fitness.</li>
